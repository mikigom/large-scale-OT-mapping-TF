### Some notes

- This repository does not contain an implementation of the entire experiment of the paper. Instead,
it confirms the thesis's core algorithm in a small toy example.

- Unlike the original paper, total batch-wise optimization is not implemented but I believe that it makes little difference.

- To run experiments, run `run.sh`.

- L2 regularization generally looks better than entropic regularization.

### Requirements
```
python3
tensorflow
matplotlib
seaborn
...
```

## Results (on L2 regularization)

##### Source and Target

Source points are green and target points are red.

##### Monge Map Estimation
